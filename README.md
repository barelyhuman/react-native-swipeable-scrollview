# react-native-swipeable-scrollview

Simpler bottom sheet using scrollviews

## Why?

This is an extracted piece of code from most of my simple bottom sheet implementations where heavy libraries for a simple scroll set animation isn't required. This library **doesn't use gesture-handler or reanimated** and is based off of the default views from react-native instead. If you do need something extensive, consider using the below alternative(s):

## Installation

```sh
npm install react-native-swipeable-scrollview
```

## Usage

```js
import SwipeableScrollview from "react-native-swipeable-scrollview";

// ...

return ()
<SwipeableScrollview
  breakpoints={['40%', '92%']}
  containerStyles={styles.bottomSheet} >
  <View>
    <Text>hello world</Text>
  </View>
</SwipeableScrollview>
```
